Jeremy is a PhD candidate in Applied Statistical Mathematics at the University of Bath. He is a member of cohort 6 of the SAMBa (Statistical Applied Mathematics Bath) CDT. His current work focuses on the collective behaviour of stochastic interacting agents and its links to kinematic flows and is being supervised by [Professor Tim Rogers](https://people.bath.ac.uk/ma3tcr/) and [Professor Paul Milewski](https://www.bath.ac.uk/profiles/head-of-department-of-mathematical-sciences-paul-milewski/).

Previously he read Theoretical Physics at the University of Manchester, writing his thesis on spatial control in football in collaboration with Manchester City Football Club.
