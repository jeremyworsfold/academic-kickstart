The Postgraduate Seminar Series (PSS) is a series of talks given by postgraduate students in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, to an audience of postgraduate students. It is an opportunity for postgraduates to gain experience of presenting in a relaxed environment, to learn about other areas of mathematics by listening to accessible talks, and to get to know more about other postgraduates in the department and their research interests.

The styles and subjects vary greatly, as you can probably tell from the list of talks below. Due to the ongoing pandemic, these talks happen on {{< emph >}} Microsoft Teams at 10:15am on Thursdays {{< /emph >}}. If you want to get involved, whether that be to give a PSS talk or just to watch then email either me at jw3286@bath.ac.uk or Piotr at pwm27@bath.ac.uk.

For information of the PSS talks from last year, visit the [PSS website 2019/20](https://yvonnek-web.gitlab.io/bath/pss/) or download a complete list of every PSS ever [here](/PSS_talks.xlsx).
