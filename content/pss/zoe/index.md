title: Concentrated Vorticity in the Euler equations 
event: Bath Postgraduate Student Seminar

abstract: "In this talk I will give an overview of what I spend my time looking at. I will begin with the Euler and Navier Stokes equations and bring you all the way to the specific case that I am interested in- incompressible, stationary, Euler with helical symmetry and concentrated vorticity. I will try to give an overview and highlight the problems with the research so far whilst trying not to bore you with too many mentions of epsilon."
