title: Cars, Pedestrians and Fish as Interacting Brownian Particles
event: Bath Postgraduate Student Seminar

abstract: "Why do traffic jams appear on a stretch of road when there’s no crash or bottleneck? Why do fish decide to swim in the same direction? This talk will give an overview on the work I’ve been doing on stochastic interacting particle systems. We’ll see how we can take a relatively simple, general model for a group of particles and describe how it behaves on a large scale and why this could answer the questions above. I’ll show you some examples, some grounded in real world scenarios and one which is simply bizarre, but all will be accompanied with pictures and animations like the one below. "
