type: talk
title: From alco-rockets and neural networks in a can to international political incidents
event: Bath Postgraduate Student Seminar

summary: Why running science projects in schools is fun?
abstract: "During the talk I will try to infect you with my passion for running science projects in schools, which may be a great thing to do in parallel with the standard academic research. The talk will include three stories from my past school projects full of risk and danger, but also fun and satisfaction.

For example, you will learn how not to construct home-made rockets or how by a *small* miscalculation you can almost cause a serious international political incident. The talk won’t include any academic math, but surely you won’t regret coming!"

There will be some equations and overviews of proofs, but it won't be super technical, and there'll also be nice pictures and diagrams so it should be possible to follow the talk without any knowledge of differential geometry at all!
