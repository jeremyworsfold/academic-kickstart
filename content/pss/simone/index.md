title: "An overview of moving mesh methods"
event: Bath Postgraduate Student Seminar

abstract: "In this talk I am going to review the main concepts underlying moving mesh strategies in 1D and their applications in numerical analysis. In particular, I will treat the notion of *equidistribution* and *monitor function*, which are essential to prove the optimality of the resulting mesh in terms of interpolation error. Finally, I will introduce the complications that arise when we move to 2D problems and mention different moving mesh strategies that are used in research."
