title: "Mathematics of beauty: How does nature shape river networks?"
event: Bath Postgraduate Student Seminar

abstract: "Did you ever wonder the river network evolve through years? Probably not. But you can still come to PSS and learn why! During the talk I will show how a beautiful fractal-like river networks we can see around us emerges from the most basic principles of fluid dynamics and how can we use satellite imaginary to further understand this phenomon. I'll start from very basics, so even those for whom fluid dynamics is still a witchcraft, can learn it and appreciate its potential."
